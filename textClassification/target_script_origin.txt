Takeshima is comprised of two islands, Higashijima (Mejima) Island and Nishijima (Ojima) Island and numerous small Islands. It is part of Okinoshima Town of Shimane Prefecture.
Takeshima is located in the Sea of Japan approximately 158 km northwest of the Oki Islands at 37Â°14' north latitude and 131Â°52' east longitude.
The total land area of Takeshima is approximately 0.20 square kilometers.
The two are precipitous volcanic islands, and cliffs abut the coastline on all sides. They have scarce vegetation and drinking water resources.
In the early 17th century the Japanese people used the islands as a fishing ground for sea lions and abalone. Sea lion hunting business started on a full scale in the early1900s.
The fact that Japan has long recognized the existence of Takeshima is made clear by a large number of early documents and maps. In the early 17th century, the Japanese government formally granted its people the right of passage to Utsuryo Island, and they used Takeshima as a navigational port and an anchorage for ships on their way to Utsuryo Island and as a ground on which to hunt and gather marine resources such as sea lions and abalone. Japan had established  sovereignty over Takeshima by the mid-17th century.
In the early 1900s, the residents of the Oki Islands of Shimane  Prefecture called for a stable environment to conduct their sea lion hunting business,  which had become a full-scale industry by then. Against this background, the Cabinet  decided to incorporate Takeshima into Shimane Prefecture and reaffirmed its sovereignty  over Takeshima. The Cabinet added Takeshima to the State Land Register, established a  license system for sea lion hunting, and charged a fee for use of the state  land. These exercises of sovereignty were carried out by the Government of  Japan peacefully and without protest from other nations. Thus Japan’s  sovereignty over Takeshima, which by then had already been established, became  clearer to other countries in terms of modern international law as well.
In the process of drafting the San Francisco Peace Treaty (signed on September 8, 1951, effective as of  April 28, 1952), which included the ultimate disposition of Japanese territory after  World War II, the Republic of Korea requested that the United States add  Takeshima to the territories to be renounced by Japan. However, the United  States unequivocally rejected this request, noting that Takeshima was “...never  treated as part of Koreaâ¦” but was Japanese territory. This is proven by diplomatic  documents disclosed by the United States government. In this context, the San  Francisco Peace Treaty lists “Korea,  including the islands of Quelpart, Port Hamilton and Dagelet” as territories  that Japan must renounce, while intentionally excluding Takeshima. Thus the  treaty, which established the international order post-World War II, affirms that  Takeshima is Japanese territory. In addition, after the treaty came into force,  the United States notified Japan that it would use Takeshima as a bombing  range. Based on the agreement with the United States, Japan designated Takeshima  as a bombing range, and announced so  to the public. Under the international order after World War II, Takeshima was unequivocally  recognized as Japanese territory.
However, in January 1952, immediately prior to the coming into force of the  San Francisco Peace Treaty, the ROK unilaterally established what is known as  the “Syngman Rhee Line” and incorporated Takeshima into the ROK side of the line. This action was  clearly inconsistent with international law, and the Japanese government promptly  and strongly protested against this act, stating that it did not recognize the line.  Nevertheless, the ROK later stationed permanent security personnel on the islands, constructing  lodgings, a monitoring facility, a lighthouse, and port and docking facilities.  The ROK’s occupation of Takeshima by force has no legal basis whatsoever, and  Japan has strongly protested against each of these acts, demanding Korea’s  withdrawal. Any measures the ROK takes regarding Takeshima based on this type  of illegal occupation have neither legal justification nor any legal effect as grounds  for its sovereignty claim.*1 *2
Japan  has consistently followed the path of a peaceful nation since the end of World  War II, and in order to seek a peaceful solution has proposed no less than  three times since 1954 that the dispute of territorial sovereignty over Takeshima  be referred to the International Court of  Justice. However, the ROK has rejected all such proposals. It is  extremely regrettable that the ROK, which plays an important role in the  international arena, has turned its back on a solution based on international  law.Â  Japan will continue to take appropriate  measures to resolve this dispute peacefully and calmly in accordance with  international law.
*1 In 2012, then-President Lee Myung-bak landed on Takeshima for the first time as the incumbent president. Since then, the government of the ROK and National Assembly members have also landed on Takeshima. Recently, Moon Jae-in, former Chairman of The Minjoo Party of Korea, landed on Takeshima in July 2016. Following each of these instances, the Government of Japan immediately conveyed to the government of the ROK that such an act was unacceptable and extremely regrettable in light of Japanâs position on sovereignty over Takeshima, urged the government of the ROK to ensure similar acts do not recur, and strongly protested against the act.
*2 The series of actions carried out by the ROK lacks any evidential power in international law and has no effect on the determination of sovereignty because Japan has continuously protested against it since the very beginning of the territorial dispute triggered by the illegal unilateral establishment of the âSyngman Rhee Line.â 
		 					In addition, the ROK claims that the occupation of Takeshima is an act to restore its sovereignty. In order to justify its claim, the ROK needs to present proof that Korea had effective control over Takeshima prior to Japan's effective control over Takeshima and reaffirmation of its territorial sovereignty in 1905. However, the ROK has never demonstrated any such proof thus far.
The group of islands currently called Takeshima was once known as âMatsushima,â and the island now called Utsuryo Island used to be known as âTakeshimaâ or âIsotakeshima.â (Fig. 1) Although the names of Takeshima and Utsuryo Island were temporarily confused due to errors in the charting of Utsuryo Island by European explorers and others, it can be confirmed from a variety of maps and documents that Japan has long recognized the existence of âTakeshimaâ and âMatsushima.â. For example, on many maps, including the Kaisei Nippon Yochi Rotei Zenzu (Revised Complete Map of Japanese Lands and Roads â first published in 1779 by Nagakubo Sekisui), which is the most prominent published cartographic projection of Japan, the locations of Utsuryo Island and Takeshima are accurately recorded at their current positions between the Korean Peninsula and the Oki Islands.

In 1787, the French explorer, Jean-Francois de Galaup, Comte de La Perouse, reached Utsuryo Island and named the island âDagelet.â After that, the British explorer, James Colnett, also reached Utsuryo Island in 1789 and named it âArgonaut.â However, as there was some inaccuracy in the latitudinal and longitudinal charting, Utsuryo Island ended up being depicted as consisting of two separate islands on the maps subsequently produced in Europe. (Fig. 2)
â²Fig. 1. Old names
â²Fig. 2. Late 19th century names
A doctor named Philipp Franz von Siebold, who had been based on the island of Dejima in Nagasaki, created a âMap of Japanâ (1840) in Europe. He had learned from various Japanese documents and maps that two groups of islands which were, from the west, âTakeshimaâ (the current Utsuryo Island) and âMatsushimaâ (the current Takeshima), were located between the Oki Islands and the Korean Peninsula. At the same time, he also knew that there were two groups of islands named, from the west, âArgonautâ and âDageletâ on European maps. Consequently, Siebold listed âArgonautâ as âTakashimaâ and âDageletâ as âMatsushimaâ on his map. (Fig. 2) This caused further confusion by giving a different name, âMatsushima,â to Utsuryo Island, which had consistently been called âTakeshimaâ or âIsotakeshima.â until then.
Thus, the long-held knowledge of âTakeshimaâ and âMatsushimaâ in Japan coexisted with the names that subsequently came from the Western world. In this confusion, Japanese who could see âMatsushimaâ in the distance requested that the government develop the island. The government implemented a field study in 1880 in order to clarify the relationship among the different names of the islands, and confirmed that the island referred to as âMatsushimaâ in the request was actually Utsuryo Island.
In this way, Utsuryo Island came to be called âMatsushima,â which raised the question of what to call the current Takeshima. To resolve this issue, the Japanese Government, while taking into account the opinion of Shimane Prefecture, changed the traditional names, officially naming the current Takeshima as such in 1905.
There is no evidence indicating that the ROK has long recognized the existence of Takeshima. For example, the ROK claims that, based on descriptions in old Korean texts including the âSamguksagiâ (History of the Three Kingdoms: 1145), âSejong Sillok, Jirijiâ (Geographical Appendix to the Veritable Records of King Sejong: 1454), âSinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnamâ (Revised and Augmented Edition of the Survey of the Geography of Korea: 1531), âDongguk Munheon Bigoâ (Reference Compilation of Documents on Korea: 1770), âMan'gi Yoramâ (Manual of State Affairs for the Monarch: 1808) and âJeungbo Munheon Bigoâ (Revised and Augmented Reference Compilation of Documents on Korea: 1908), Koreans had long been aware of the existence of the two islands of Utsuryo and Usan, and that this âUsan Islandâ is the current Takeshima.
However, whereas the âHistory of the Three Kingdomsâ contains a description of Utsuryo Island, which belonged to Usan Country, becoming a part of Silla in 512, there is no mention of âUsan Island.â Meanwhile, in other ancient Korean documents, âUsan Islandâ is described as a place where many people lived and large bamboo plants were cultivated, which does not represent the realities of Takeshima and sounds more like Utsuryo Island.
The ROK claims that âUsan Islandâ is Dokdo (the Korean name for Takeshima) based on the description that includes âUsan Island is what the Japanese called Matsushimaâ in âYeojijiâ (Record of Geography: 1656) cited in the âReference Compilation of Documents on Korea,â âManual of State Affairs for the Monarchâ and âManual of State Affairs for the Monarch.â On the other hand, there are more critical studies pointing out that the original text inã the âRecord of Geographyâ indicates that âUsan Islandâ and âUtsuryo Islandâ refer to exactly the same island and that the description in documents such as the âReference Compilation of Documents on Koreaâ do not directly or accurately quote from the âRecord of Geography.â Such studies point out that the descriptions in those documents were copied from âGanggyegoâ (Study of National Boundaries: 1756) which had uncritically cited a less reliable statement by a man called Ahn Yong-bok.
In the map attached to the âRevised and Augmented Edition of the Survey of the Geography of Korea,â âUtsuryo Islandâ and âUsan Islandâ are described as two separate islands. If, as the ROK claims, âUsan Islandâ is the current Takeshima, it should have been described as a much smaller island than Utsuryo Island and located east of Utsuryo Island. However, the âUsan Islandâ on this map is illustrated as being roughly of the same size as Utsuryo Island, and situated between the Korean Peninsula and Utsuryo Island (west of Utsuryo Island), indicating  that the island does not exist.

In 1618 (Note), Ohya Jinkichi and Murakawa Ichibei, merchants from Yonago, HÅki Province, in Tottori Domain, received permission for passage to Utsuryo Island (then called âTakeshimaâ in Japan) from the shogunate via the lord of Tottori. Following that, the two families took turns in traveling to Utsuryo Island once each year, and engaging in catching abalone, hunting sea lions and felling trees.
Note: Some believe that this was in 1625.
Both families engaged in fishing around Utsuryo Island using ships with the hollyhock crest of the ruling shogunate family on the sails, and usually presented the abalone they caught as gifts to the shogunate and others. Thus they monopolized the management of the island with the de facto approval of the shogunate.
During this period, Takeshima, on the route from Oki to Utsuryo Island, came to be used as a navigational port, docking point for ships, and rich fishing ground for sea lions and abalone.
As a consequence of the above facts, Japan had established sovereignty over Takeshima by the mid-17th century (early Edo period) at the latest.
If the shogunate had considered Utsuryo Island and Takeshima to be foreign territories at the time, it would have banned passage to these islands in 1635 when it issued its directives to close Japan to the outside world and to prohibit Japanese from traveling abroad. However, no such ban was issued.
â²Permission for passage (Tottori Prefectural Museum)
With the permission of the shogunate for passage to Utsuryo Island, the Ohya and Murakawa families in Yonago had carried out their monopolistic business activities without intervention for approximately seventy years.
When the Murakawa family traveled to Utsuryo Island in 1692, they encountered many Koreans engaging in fishing on the island. The following year, the Ohya family also encountered a number of Korean people on the island, and brought two of them, Ahn Yong-Bok and Pak Eo-Doon, back to Japan. At this time, the Korean royal dynasty prohibited its people from traveling to Utsuryo Island.
By order of the shogunate, which was now aware of the situation, Tsushima Domain (which served as the contact point with the Korean dynasty during the Edo period) repatriated Ahn and Pak to Korea, and initiated negotiations with Korea requesting that it prohibit its people from traveling to Utsuryo Island. However, there was a conflict of opinion over the attribution of Utsuryo Island and no agreement was reached in these negotiations.
Notified of the failure of the negotiations by Tsushima Domain, the shogunate decided to prohibit passage to Utsuryo Island in January 1696, recognizing that as no Japanese had settled on Utsuryo Island, and that the distance from the Korean Peninsula was shorter than that from HÅki Province, Tottori Domain, it was not wise to ruin a good relationship with a neighboring country for the sake of what was seen as a small unprofitable island, and that it would be sufficient to ban passage to Utsuryo Island because it had not been incorporated into Japan. The shogunate instructed Tottori Domain that passage by Japanese to Utsuryo Island was now prohibited, and ordered Tsushima Domain to inform the Korean dynasty of this decision.
The series of the negotiations concerning the attribution of Utsuryo Island is generally known as the âTakeshima Ikkenâ (Takeshima Affair).
However, actually, passage to Takeshima was not banned. This clearly shows that Japan already regarded Takeshima as its territory at that time.
Ahn Yong-Bok returned to Japan after the shogunate prohibited passage to Utsuryo Island, following which he was repatriated to Korea and interrogated by Korean officials for violating the prohibition of passage to Utsuryo Island. The statement made by Ahn at that time is cited by the ROK today as one of the foundations for its claim to sovereignty over Takeshima.
According to documents held by the ROK, Ahn Yong-Bok stated that while in Japan in 1693 he had received a document from the Tokugawa shogunate acknowledging its recognition of Utsuryo Island and Takeshima as territories of Korea, but that the lord of Tsushima had seized this document. However, negotiations between Japan and Korea over fishing around Utsuryo Island began in 1693, when Ahn was taken to Japan then repatriated via Tsushima Domain. Thus, the Tokugawa shogunate would never have given him a memorandum saying that Utsuryo Island and Takeshima were Korean territory when he came over in 1693, and in fact it did not.
Moreover, the documents held by the ROK show that Ahn Yong-Bok stated during his visit to Japan in 1696 that he saw many Japanese on Utsuryo Island. However, his visit was after the shogunate had decided to ban passage to Utsuryo Island, and so neither the Ohya nor the Murakawa family was traveling to the island at that time.
The records related to Ahn Yong-Bok in the documents held by the ROK are based on the statements made during his interrogation upon his return to Korea after traveling overseas in violation of the national prohibition in 1696. There are numerous inconsistencies with the facts in his statements, including those mentioned above, but they have been cited by the ROK as one of its foundations for claiming sovereignty over Takeshima.
It was in the early years of the 20th century that full-scale sea lion hunting started around Takeshima. However, sea lion hunting soon led to problems of excessive competition; so, in order to stabilize the sea lion hunting business, Nakai YÅzaburo, a resident of the Oki Islands in Shimane Prefecture, submitted a request in September 1904 to three government ministers (the Home Minister, the Foreign Minister, and the Agriculture and Commerce Minister) for the incorporation of the âLyanko Islandsâ into Japanese territory and for a ten-year lease.
Note: âLyanko Islandsâ was the Japanese colloquial term for Takeshima derived from âLiancourt Islands,â the Western name given to Takeshima. Due to charting errors by European explorers, Utsuryo Island was also called âMatsushima,â and the present Takeshima was called the âLyanko Islands.â
Upon this request from Nakai, and after hearing the opinion of Shimane Prefecture, the government confirmed that there were no issues involved in bringing Takeshima under the jurisdiction of the Oki Islands branch office of the Shimane Prefectural Government and that âTakeshimaâ was an appropriate name for the islands. Accordingly, in January 1905, the government stipulated, through a Cabinet decision, that the islands would come under the jurisdiction of the Oki Islands branch office of the Shimane Prefectural Government and that the islands would be officially named âTakeshima.â This was communicated to the Governor of Shimane Prefecture by the Minister of Home Affairs. With this Cabinet decision, Japan reaffirmed its sovereignty over Takeshima.
Based on the Cabinet decision and the ministerial instruction from the Minister of Home Affairs, the Governor of Shimane Prefecture announced in February 1905 that Takeshima was officially named âTakeshimaâ and that it was under the jurisdiction of the Oki Islands branch of the Shimane Prefectural Government, which was also informed of these matters. These measures were published in the newspapers of the day and were widely publicized.
â²Cabinet Decision of January 28, 1905 (National Archives of Japan)
As the Cabinet Decision stipulated that Takeshima came under the jurisdiction of the Oki Islands branch office of the Shimane Prefectural Government, the governor added Takeshima to the State Land Register, and introduced a license system for hunting sea lions, the hunting of which continued until 1941.
The ROK maintains that, with Korean Imperial Ordinance No. 41 of 1900, Utsuryo Island was renamed Utsu Island and the island administrator became the county magistrate. This ordinance stipulated that the region under the jurisdiction of Utsu Island County was âall of Utsuryo Island, Takeshima and Ishi-jima,â and some researchers argue that, although this âTakeshimaâ refers to a small island called âJukdoâ near Utsuryo Island, âIshi-jimaâ (Stone Island) actually corresponds to the current âDokdo,â because âIshiâ (Dol) is also pronounced as âDokâ in Korean dialect and âIshi-jimaâ can be written as âDokdoâ in Chinese characters based on the pronunciation.
However, if âIshi-jimaâ corresponds to the current âTakeshimaâ (âDokdoâ), then a number of questions arise, including why the Imperial Ordinance of 1900 did not use âDokdoâ as the island's name, why it used âIshijima,â and why the name âUsan Islandâ (or another name), which the ROK claims to be the former name of Takeshima, was not used.
Even if these questions are answered, there is still no evidence that the ROK had control over Takeshima when the imperial ordinance was promulgated. Therefore it is considered that Korea had never established sovereignty over Takeshima.

The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) designated the areas where Japan had to cease exerting political and administrative power and the areas where it was restricted from engaging in fishing or whaling, which included Takeshima. These directives, however, stated that they should not be construed as an indication of Allied policy relating to the ultimate determination of the assignment of Japanese sovereign territory.
The descriptions in the related Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Instruction Note (SCAPIN) are as follows:
(1) SCAPIN No. 677
 (a) In January 1946, SCAP issued SCAPIN No. 677 to instruct Japan to provisionally cease exerting or attempting to exert political or administrative power over some areas.
(b) Paragraph 3 of the note states, âFor the purpose of this directive, Japan is defined to include the four main islands of Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku) and the approximately 1,000 smaller adjacent islands, including the Tsushima Islands and the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands north of 30 degrees North Latitude (excluding Kuchinoshima Island)â and listed Utsuryo Island, Cheju Island, the Izu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and Takeshima as the areas not included with those where Japan was allowed to exert political or administrative power.
(c) Paragraph 6 of the same note, however, clearly states that â[n]othing in this directive shall be construed as an indication of Allied policy relating to the ultimate determination of the minor islands referred to in Article 8 of the Potsdam Declaration.â (Potsdam Declaration, Article 8: âJapanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.â)
(2) SCAPIN No. 1033
(a) In June 1946, SCAP issued SCAPIN No. 1033 to expand the areas where Japanese were permitted to engage in fishing and whaling (the âMacArthur Lineâ).
(b) Paragraph 3 of the note states âJapanese vessels or personnel thereof will not approach closer than twelve (12) miles to Takeshima (37Â°15' North Latitude, 131Â°53' East Longitude) nor have any contact with said island.â
(c) Paragraph 5 of the same instruction note, however, states that â[t]he present authorization is not an expression of allied [sic] policy relative to [the] ultimate determination of national jurisdiction, international boundaries or fishing rights in the area concerned or in any other area.â
The abolishment of the âMacArthur Lineâ was directed in April 25, 1952, and three days after, on April 28, the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, which consequently nullified the directive to cease Japan's political and administrative power in the aforementioned areas.
		 						The ROK claims that the Allies did not recognize Takeshima as part of Japan's territory based on the SCAPIN documents mentioned above, and includes them in the evidence for its claim of sovereignty over Takeshima. However, both of the SCAPIN documents clearly state that they shall not be construed as an indication of Allied policy relating to the ultimate determination of the assignment of Japanese sovereignty, and therefore such claims are obviously incorrect.
The territory of Japan was determined by the San Francisco Peace Treaty when it subsequently came into effect. This clearly shows that none of the treatment of Takeshima prior to the effect of that Treaty affects the title to Takeshima.
â²SCAPIN No. 677
â²SCAPIN No.1033
The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed in September 1951, stipulated that Japan should recognize the independence of Korea, and that Japan should renounce all rights, titles and claims to âKorea, including the islands of Quelpart, Port Hamilton and Dagelet.â
Upon learning of this section drafted by the United States and the United Kingdom, in July 1951 the ROK submitted a letter to Dean G. Acheson, the Secretary of State of the United States, from Yang Yu Chan, ROK Ambassador to the United States. This letter contained the following statement: âMy Government requests that the word ârenounces' in Paragraph A, Article Number 2, should be replaced by âconfirms that it renounced on August 9, 1945, all rights, titles and claims to Korea and the islands which were part of Korea prior to its annexation by Japan, including the islands [of] Quelpart, Port Hamilton, Dagelet, Dokdo and Parangdo'.â
In response to this request from the ROK, in August of the same year the United States submitted a letter (an excerpt of which is shown below) from Dean Rusk, United States Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, to Ambassador Yang, and in it clearly denied the claims of the ROK.
		 						â...the United States Government does not feel that the Treaty [the San Francisco Peace Treaty] should adopt the theory that Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration on August 9, 1945 constituted a formal or final renunciation of sovereignty by Japan over the areas dealt with in the Declaration. As regards to the island of Dokdo, otherwise known as Takeshima or Liancourt Rocks, this normally uninhabited rock formation was according to our information never treated as part of Korea and, since about 1905, has been under the jurisdiction of the Oki Islands Branch Office of Shimane Prefecture of Japan. The island does not appear ever before to have been claimed by Korea.â
		 						Based on this correspondence, in the San Francisco Peace Treaty, it is obvious that Takeshima was affirmed as a territory of Japan.
The report by Ambassador Van Fleet after visiting the ROK in 1954 and returning to the United States also states that the United States concluded that Takeshima was a territory of Japan and the island was not included among the islands that Japan released from its sovereignty under the San Francisco Peace Treaty.

In July 1951, while Japan was still under Allied occupation, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers designated Takeshima as a bombing range for the U.S. Forces by SCAPIN No. 2160.
In July 1952, right after the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, in response to the desire of the U.S. Forces to continue to use Takeshima as a training area, the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee, established as the consultative body for the implementation of the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement (an agreement based on the former Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, which was later succeeded by the current Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement), designated Takeshima as a bombing range for the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs published this fact in its official gazette.
However, because local residents wished to engage in sea lion hunting, abalone fishing and seaweed harvesting in the waters around Takeshima, and the U.S. Forces had stopped using Takeshima as a bombing range as of the winter of 1952, in March 1953 the Joint Committee decided to release Takeshima from the designation of a bombing range for the U.S. Forces.
The Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement stipulated that the Joint Committee should serve as the means for consultation in making determinations about facilities and areas in Japan. Therefore, the fact that Takeshima was discussed by the Committee and the fact that the island was designated as an area for use by the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan clearly indicate that Takeshima is part of the territory of Japan.
â²Designation as a training area for the U.S. Forces (official gazette)
In January 1952, the President of the ROK, Syngman Rhee, issued a declaration concerning maritime sovereignty, with which he established the âSyngman Rhee Line.â Establishment of this line, encompassing the island of Takeshima and a large area of water with fisheries jurisdiction, was a unilateral act in contravention of international law.
In March 1953, the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee decided to release Takeshima from the designation of a bombing range for the U.S. Forces. This enabled Japanese to resume fishing around Takeshima, but it was confirmed that Koreans were also engaging in fishing around the island. In July of the same year, a Japanese patrol vessel of the Maritime Safety Agency (now the Japan Coast Guard) demanding that Koreans engaged in illegal fishing leave Takeshima was fired upon by Korean authorities who were protecting the Korean fishermen.
In June 1954, the ROK Ministry of Home Affairs announced that the ROK Coast Guard had dispatched a permanent battalion to Takeshima. In August of the same year, a vessel of the Maritime Safety Agency on patrol near Takeshima was fired on from the island, and with this incident it was confirmed that ROK security personnel had been stationed on Takeshima.
Since then, the ROK has kept security personnel stationed on Takeshima and constructed lodgings, a monitoring facility, a lighthouse, and port and docking facilities.
The establishment of the Syngman Rhee Line constitutes an illegal delineation of the high seas , and the occupation of Takeshima by the ROK constitutes an illegal occupation undertaken without basis in international law. No measures taken by the ROK during its illegal occupation concerning Takeshima have any legal justification. Such acts can never be accepted in light of Japanâs position regarding its sovereignty over Takeshima. Japan has strongly protested against each and every measure taken by the ROK and has demanded the withdrawal of said measures each time.
â²Photo of the Japan Coast Guard patrol vessel that was fired upon (July 1953) (Photograph courtesy of the Yomiuri Shimbun)
â²Map
Following the establishment of the Syngman Rhee Line by the ROK, Japan has repeatedly protested strongly against each action by the ROK; actions that include the ROKâs own claims of sovereignty over Takeshima, fishing activities around Takeshima, firing on patrol vessels, and the construction of structures on the islands.
For the peaceful settlement of the dispute, Japan proposed in September 1954 to the ROK with a note verbale that this dispute over the sovereignty of Takeshima be referred to the International Court of Justice (the ICJ). However, the ROK rejected the proposal in October of the same year (Note 1) In addition, on the occasion of the foreign ministerial talks in March 1962, ZentarÅ Kosaka, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan, made a proposal to Choi Duk Shin, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the ROK, to refer the dispute to the ICJ, but this proposal was again not accepted by the ROK.
In addition, in August 2012, Japan delivered another note verbale to propose referring the dispute on the sovereignty over Takeshima to the ICJ once again, after Lee Myung-bak, the then President of the Republic of Korea, became the first ever Korean president to visit Takeshima. However, the ROK rejected Japanâs proposal in the same month (Note 2).
Note 1: Referral to the ICJ was also suggested to the ROK by the US in 1954. In the report he made on his return home, Ambassador Van Fleet noted that â[t]hough the United States considers that the islands are Japanese territory [â¦] [o]ur position has been that the dispute might properly be referred to the International Court of Justice and this suggestion has been informally conveyed to the Republic of Korea.â
â²Report by Ambassador Van Fleet
Note 2: The ICJ has jurisdiction over a dispute only when all parties to the dispute have agreed to seek its settlement in the Court. Since 1958, Japan has accepted the ICJâs compulsory jurisdiction even when another country brings a unilateral suit against it without Japanâs consent, as Japan respects the rule of law in the international community. However, the ROK does not take the same stance. As a result, even if Japan refers the case unilaterally to the ICJ, it has no jurisdiction as long as the ROK does not accept it.
A1The Republic of Korea (hereafter, ROK) alleges that the geographical proximity of Takeshima to Utsuryo Island proves that Takeshima is geographically part of Utsuryo Island. However, in international law, geographical proximity itself has no significance with regard to territorial sovereignty. This understanding is apparent in precedents set by international courts.
For example, back in the 1920s, when the United States and the Netherlands disputed sovereignty over the Island of Palmas, the Arbitration court ruled: âThe title of contiguity, understood as a basis of territorial sovereignty, has no foundation in international lawâ¦.â Furthermore, recently, in its Judgment in the Case concerning the Territorial and Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea (2007), the ICJ did not recognize the geographical proximity that Nicaragua claimed should be involved as an element in determining sovereignty over maritime features of the disputed area. Additionally, in the case concerning the dispute over the islands of Ligitan and Sipadan between Indonesia and Malaysia (2002), the ICJ rejected the contention of Indonesia that the two islands, 40 nautical miles from an island in regard to which sovereignty was not disputed, were islets belonging to it.
A2No. While the ROK claims that the Usan Island listed in their period documents and maps is the current Takeshima, there are no grounds for this claim.
The ROK claims, using Korean period documents, that it has been aware of the two islands of Utsuryo Island and Usan Island for centuries, and that Usan Island is none other than the current Takeshima. However, no proof has been found for the ROK's claim that the Usan Island in Korean period documents is in fact the current Takeshima.
For example, in Sejong Sillok, Jiriji (Geography Section of the Annals of King Sejong's Reign: 1454) and Sinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam (Revised and Augmented Edition of the Survey of the Geography of Korea: 1531), the ROK claims that the two islands of Usan and Utsuryo are listed as being in the sea to the east of the prefecture of Uljin, which means that this Usan Island is Takeshima. However, Sejong Sillok, Jiriji notes that âIn the Shilla Period, it was called Usan Province. It was also called Utsuryo Island. The land is a hundred square ri.â (æ°ç¾æç§°äºå±±å½ä¸äºæ¬éµå³¶å°æ¹ç¾é), and in Sinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam it is referred to in the following: âIn one theory, Usan and Utsuryo are originally the same island. Its area is a hundred square ri." (ä¸èª¬äºå±±æ¬éµæ¬ä¸å³¶å°æ¹ç¾é).  These documents do not contain anything specific regarding Usan Island; they contain only writings concerning Utsuryo Island. There are also Korean documents that clearly show that Usan Island is not the current Takeshima. For example, Volume 33 of the Annals of King Taejong, covering February of the 17th year of his reign (1417), contains the statement that âRoyal Inspector Kim In-u returned from Usan Island and brought local products as tribute, including large bamboos [â¦]. He also brought back three residents of the place. There were about fifteen families living on the island for a total of 86 men and women.â (ææ«ä½¿ééºé¨éèªäºå±±å³¶ç»åç£å¤§ç«¹æ°´çç®çè§ç¶¿å­æ¿æ²æ¨ç­ç©ä¸çå±äººä¸åä»¥æ¥å¶å³¶æ¸å¡åäºå£ç·å¥³å¹¶å«åå­)  However, there is no bamboo on Takeshima, nor could 86 people live there.

The ROK claims that the Dongguk Munheon Bigo (Reference Compilation of Documents on Korea: 1770) and other documents which state âUtsuryo and Usan are all land belonging to Usan Province, and Usan is called Matsushima in Japan,â but these documents dating from the 18th century or later are based on an unreliable statement by a man named Ahn Yong-bok who had illegally entered Japan in 1696 (refer to Q&A (3)). In addition, although editors of documents in the 18th and 19th centuries may have written âUsan is called Matsushima in Japan,â this does not mean that the âUsanâ mentioned in the 15th century Sejong Sillok Jiriji (Geographical Appendix to the Veritable Records of King Sejong) or the 16th century Sinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam (A Revised Edition of the Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea) is in fact Takeshima.
The ROK also insists that Korean maps dating from the 16th century show Takeshima as Usan Island, but the Usan Island shown on Korean maps to date is not Takeshima.
* Note that in terms of international law, maps that are not associated with treaties are not considered to be a basis for territorial claims, and even maps associated with treaties have only a supplementary meaning as the intent of the treaty signers is expressed in the main text.
For example, the map attached to Sinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam (Revised and Augmented Edition of the Survey of the Geography of Korea), âThe Map of Eight Provinces of Korea,â shows the two islands of Utsuryo Island and âUsan Island.â If âUsan Islandâ is assumed as Takeshima, as the ROK claims, then this island should have been depicted as an island far to the east of, and much smaller than, Utsuryo Island. However, the âUsan Islandâ in this map is between the Korean peninsula and Utsuryo Island, and is shown to be about the same size as Utsuryo Island. Therefore, the âUsan Islandâ in the Map of Eight Provinces of Korea is either Utsuryo Island shown as two islands, or a non-existent island, and not Takeshima, which is far to the east of Utsuryo Island.

In maps of Korea dating from the 18th century, Usan Island appears to the east of Utsuryo Island. However, this Usan Island is not the current Takeshima.
For example, in the Utsuryo Island Map connected with Bak Seok-chang's inspection tour of Utsuryo Island in 1711, âUsan Islandâ is shown to the east of Utsuryo Island, but there is a note there that reads âthe so-called Usan Island, field(s) of haejang bamboo.â This haejang bamboo or âSimon bambooâ is a type of bamboo grass, but as the rocky islands of Takeshima are unable to grow this sort of vegetation, this Usan Island cannot be Takeshima. Note that haejang bamboo grows on Jukdo,* an island about 2 km to the east of Utsuryo Island. This suggests that the âUsan Islandâ shown in the Utsuryo Island Map is in fact Jukdo.
Note: Jukdo is a small island about 2 km east of Utsuryo Island
â²Survey Map of Utsuryo Island by the Navy Hydrographic Department 
The noted Korean cartographer, Kim Jeong-ho, created a map called the Cheonggudo in 1834, which in the Utsuryo Island Map shows a long, narrow island called âUsanâ to the east of Utsuryo Island.
This map includes distance markings (one distance marking is ten Korean ri, about 4 km) on all four sides, so distances are clear. From the fact that the island is only shown about 2 or 3 km from Utsuryo Island, and from its shape, it is clearly Jukdo, which is about 2 km to the east of Utsuryo Island (and not Takeshima, which is about 90 km away). 
In other words, the âUsanâ shown on maps of Korea from the 18th century is probably Jukdo.

Maps which showed Jukdo, about 2 km to the east of Utsuryo Island, as âUsanâ were created in the modern era. The Daehanjeondo, printed by the Academic Editorial Bureau of the Korean Empire in 1899, is a modern map with lines of latitude and longitude, and it too shows âUsanâ right by Utsuryo Island. This âUsanâ is also Jukdo, and not the current Takeshima.

 Recognition of Takeshima (Recognition of Takeshima in Korea)
A3Ahn Yong-bok was a Korean man who set out to go fishing at Utsuryo Island (which was called âTakeshimaâ in Japan at the time) in 1693, was taken to Japan by the Ohya family, and who then returned to Japan of his own volition in 1696 to sue Tottori Domain. However, after that, he was arrested and interrogated by the Korean authorities for leaving the country without permission. Under interrogation, Ahn said that he met Japanese on Utsuryo Island and accused them of infringing the border, and that,having heard Japanese were living on Matsushima, he considered Matsushima to be Jasan Island, which was also Korean territory. This is how the story later developed in Korean documents that Usan Island and today's Takeshima (or âDokdoâ in Korean) were connected.
							
The ROK uses this statement by Ahn Yong-bok as one of its proofs of sovereignty over Takeshima.
This statement by Ahn Yong-bok was recorded in the Annals of King Sukjong in the 9th month of the 22nd year of the reign of King Sukjong (1696). However, the same document (for February of the following year) records the repudiation by the Korean dynasty of Ahn's actions, and so we can see that Korea recognized that his actions did not represent Korea (See Supplemental 1). In addition, there are a number of aspects in his statement which do not match the reality, so it lacks credibility (See Supplemental 2).
It is clear from the following points that Ahn Yong-bok did not represent Korea.
Ahn Yong-bok's trip to Japan is evaluated as follows  in the Annals of King Sukjong.
“The Dongnae government official Yi [Sejaeä¸è¼] told the king that the  emissary from Tsushima asked, ‘A man of your country attempted to charge us  with a complaint: is this the doings of your court?’ (å»ç§è²´å½äººæååäºåºæ¼æä»¤è¶). In response to this, Yi stated that ‘If there is  something to explain here, an official interpreter will be sent to Edo, and  there is no reason we would send a fisherman, as if we were afraid (è¥æå¯å¼éä¸è¨³æ¼æ±æ¸é¡§ä½ææèä¹éçè ¢æµ¦æ°è¶). [â¦] The Border Defense Council of Joseon stated  that ‘â¦the government of Korea has nothing to do with what ignorant people who  are blown by the winds may say.’ (â¦è³æ¼æ¼é¢¨ææ°è¨­ææä½çºäº¦éæå®¶æç¥) The reply to this effect to  the Tsushima emissary was conferred over, and the king gave his consent(è«ä»¥æ­¤è¨åé¤¨å­åä¹).” (From Sukjong 23rd year)
The Korean dynasty’s repudiation was passed on to Japan in a  letter sent to the lord of Tsushima Domain from Yi Seon-bak, Deputy Vice-Minister for  Protocol:
“With regard to the man who drifted ashore last year,  those who live on the seaside make their living sailing, and when caught in a storm,  they are immediately driven before the waves to arrive at your country (æ¨å¹´æ¼æ°äºæ¿±æµ·ä¹äººçä»¥èæ¥«çºæ¥­é¢¿é¢¨ç±å¿½æåé£çªä»¥è³åè¶éæºè½å¥è²´å½). [..] If there was a charge  laid by him, he committed crime of forging a letter (â¦è¥å¶åæ¸èª æå¦ä½ä¹ç½ª). Therefore we have already exiled  him in accordance with the law (æå·²æ½å¹½æ®ä¹å¸ä»¥çºæ²æ¢ä¹å°).”
Note: Tsushima Domain was the only official route for  diplomacy and trade between Japan and Korea in the Edo period.
Ahn Yong-bok’s boat was flying a flag which read  “Taxation General of the Two Islands of Utsuryo Island, Joseon. Vassal Ahn on  Board,” and Ahn styled himself “Tax Inspector for the Two Islands of Utsuryo  and Usan.” This title was made up, and Ahn himself admitted this identity fraud.  The “Tax Inspector” or “Auditor-General” that Ahn Yong-bok called himself  referred to a tax collector for the islands of Utsuryo and Usan. Ahn apparently  believed that Usan Island was a large populated island.
There are numerous discrepancies in Ahn Yong-bok's statements, making themunreliable.
Ahn Yong-bok came to Japan twice. The first time was  in 1693, when he was taken to Japan as proof that there was no fishing to be  had around Utsuryo Island (called “Takeshima” in Japan at the time). The second  time was in 1696, when he smuggled himself to Japan to lodge a protest with  Tottori Domain, and was expelled by the domain. Ahn’s statements recorded in  the Annals of King Sukjong are a  summary of the written statements made when he was interrogated by the Border  Defense Council of Joseon on his return. According to this summary, when Ahn  first came to Japan, he obtained a letter from the shogunate stating that  Utsuryo Island and Usan Island were Korean territory, but Tsushima domain took  it from him. However, negotiations between Japan and Korea over fishing around  Utsuryo Island began when Ahn was taken back to Japan and repatriated via  Tsushima Domain, so the Tokugawa shogunate would never have given him a letter saying  that Utsuryo Island and Usan Island were Korean territory when he came over in  1693, before such negotiations were started.
In addition, when Ahn Yong-bok came to Japan in May  1696, he stated that there was a large number of Japanese on Utsuryo Island.  However, in January, the sea travel licenses granted to the Ohya and Murakawa  families were repealed, because the shogunate had already decided to ban  passage to Utsuryo Island and passed the directive on to Tottori Domain. The ROK  claims that the shogunate decided to forbid travel to Utsuryo Island as a  result of Ahn’s visit to Japan in 1696, but Ahn arrived four months after the  shogunate forbade travel to the island.
Ahn Yong-bok was interrogated on his return to Korea.  It is recorded that he said to the Japanese, “Matsushima is Jasan (Usan) Island  and therefore also our country’s land, why do you dare live there?” (æ¾å³¶å³å­å±±å³¶ãæ­¤äº¦æå½å°ãæ±æ¢ä½æ­¤è¶). That year, there were no Japanese travelling to  Utsuryo Island, so this story cannot be true. It seems that Ahn Yong-bok  believed that people could live on Usan Island. When he went fishing at Utsuryo  Island in 1693, he was told by his companions that the island to the north-east  of Utsuryo Island was Usan Island (Takeshimakiji),  and when he was taken to Japan, he said that he saw “a large island, much  bigger than Utsuryo Island” (Byeonrye Jibyo).  Ahn said, “Matsushima is Jasan (Usan) Island.” It is assumed that he learned the  name “Matsushima” (today’s Takeshima) during his stay in Japan, and connected  it with Usan Island which was traditionally drawn in Korean picture maps. However,  saying that “Matsushima is Jasan Island” is, in terms of names, not actually  referring to today’s Takeshima.

Prohibition of Passage to Utsuryo Island (Statement by Ahn Yong-Bok and Questions Raised)
A4No, the ROK has not shown any proof that they owned the islands of Takeshima.
For example, the ROK states that the Usan or Usan Island appearing in Korean period documents from the Joseon period such as the "Sejong Sillok Jiriji (Geography Section of the Annals King Sejong's Reign: 1454)" and the "Sinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam (Revised and Augmented Edition of the Survey of the Geography of Korea: 1531)" is Takeshima, and so it has always been its territory.
However, âUsanâ in Korean period documents and maps is either another name for Utsuryo Island, or the separate smaller island off the coast of Utsuryo Island (Jukdo), and not Takeshima.
 Recognition of Takeshima (Recognition of Takeshima inKorea)
Q&A (2) Is Takeshima mentioned in Korean period documents or maps in the ROK?
The ROK insists that it established a county in Utsuryo Island by Korean Imperial Ordinance No.41 (1900), and established the area under the jurisdiction of Utsu Island County as âthe entire island of Utsuryo Island and the islands of Jukdo and Sokdo (ç³å³¶Ishi-jima),â and that this Sokdo is Dokdo (the Korean name for Takeshima).
However, the ROK has yet to present any clear proof that this Sokdo is in fact Takeshima. In addition, even if, hypothetically, the ordinance did refer to Takeshima, the Korean Empire never exercised actual control over Takeshima around the time of that ordinance, and so Korean territorial rights over it were never established.
The Incorporation of Takeshima into Shimane Prefecture 5. and 6.
Note: In 1882, the Korean dynasty abolished its âEmpty Islandâ policy regarding Utsuryo Island, which it had maintained for 470 years, and started to develop the island. Later, in June 1900, Korea and Japan carried out a joint survey since there were a large number of Japanese residing on Utsuryo Island. The Korean Empire (Korea changed its name from Joseon to Daehan Jeguk, the âGreat Han Empire,â in October 1897) enacted the imperial ordinance No.41 to rename Utsuryo Island as âUtsu Islandâ and to make the Island Administrator County Magistrate, based on the report of this survey (U Yong-jeong's Uldo-gi), having considered the necessity of âexchange with foreign travelers and tradersâ.In Article 2 of this ordinance the jurisdiction of Utsu Island County was set as âthe entire island of Utsuryo Island and the islands of Jukdo and Ishi-jima.â However, it is not certain where this suddenly appearing âIshi-jimaâ actually was.
According to the report of the survey carried out prior to this ordinance, the length of Utsuryo Island was 70 ri (approx. 28 km), its width was 40 ri (approx. 16 km), and its circumference was 145 ri (â¦å¨å³¶é·å¯çºä¸åéå»£å¯çºååéå¨å»»äº¦å¯çºä¸ç¾ååäºé). Also, it is stated, in the âRequest for Cabinet Decision Regarding the Change of Name of Utsuryo Island to Utsu Island and the Change from Island Administrator to County Magistrateâ (1900) by Yi Kon-ha, Minister of the Interior, that ââ¦the area of the island concerned is 80 ri on the long axis (approx. 32 km) and 50 ri across (approx. 20 km).â From these facts, it is clear that Takeshima, about 90 km away, was outside the scope, and that Ishi-jima is not Takeshima. Given that relatively large islands exist in the area around Utsuryo Island (within a few kms of the island) called Jukdo and Gwannumdo, there is a possibility that âIshi-jimaâ meant one of these islands.
1 ri (Japan) = about 10 ri (Korea) = about 4 km
A5No, it was not.
The ROK alleges that Takeshima falls under the âterritories which Japan has taken by violence and greedâ in the Cairo Declaration (1943) announced by the leaders of the United States, the United Kingdom and China during World War II. However, Takeshima has never been Korean territory, whereas Japan had established sovereignty over the islands no later than the middle of the 17th century, reaffirmed it with the islands' incorporation into Shimane Prefecture by cabinet decision in 1905, and has exercised its sovereignty peacefully and continuously. This makes it clear that Takeshima was not territory that Japan took from Korea.
The ultimate determination of territory following a war is done by a peace treaty or other forms of international agreements. In the case of World War II, it was the San Francisco Peace Treaty that legally determined Japan's territories, and the Cairo Declaration does not have any ultimate legal effect on the determination of Japanese territory. It is confirmed in the San Francisco Peace Treaty that Takeshima is Japanese territory.
Treatment of Takeshima in the San Francisco Peace Treaty
A6No, it was not. SCAP had no authority regarding the disposition of territory.
The ROK claims that SCAPIN (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Instruction Note) No. 677 (See Supplemental 1) and No. 1033(See Supplemental 2) place Takeshima outside Japanese territory. However, both of the directives explicitly stipulate that it's not an expression of allied policy relative to ultimate determination of territory, although the ROK makes no mention of this. The Korean position is therefore untenable.
It is the San Francisco Peace Treaty (effective in 1952) that decided the territory of Japan after the War. Therefore it is clear both in terms of fact and in terms of international law that the treatment of Takeshima by SCAP before that Treaty came into force has no effect on sovereignty over Takeshima.
In January 1946, the General Headquarters for the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers ordered the Japanese government to provisionally cease exercising or attempting to exercise political or administrative authority over certain outlying areas based on SCAPIN No.677. Paragraph 3 of the directive  provides that âFor the purpose of this directive, Japan is defined to include the four main islands of Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku) and the approximately 1,000 smaller adjacent islands, including the Tsushima Islands and the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands north of 30Â° North Latitude (excluding Kuchinoshima Island).âThe directive then listed Takeshima along with Utsuryo Island, Jeju Island, the Izu Islands, the Ogasawara Islands, etc. as the areas âexcluded.â
However, Paragraph 6 of the directive clearly states that âNothing in this directive shall be construed as an indication of Allied policy relating to the ultimate determination of the minor islands referred to in Article 8 of the Potsdam Declaration.â (Article 8 of the Potsdam Declaration: ââ¦Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.â) The claim of the ROK completely ignores this.

In June 1946, SCAP expanded the area authorized for Japan's fishing and whaling (the so-called âMacArthur Lineâ) by SCAPIN No. 1033. Paragraph 3 of the directive stipulates that âJapanese vessels or personnel thereof will not approach closer than twelve (12) miles to Takeshima (37Â°15' North Latitude, 131Â°53' East Longitude) nor have any contact with said island.â
However, Paragraph 5 of the directive explicitly provides that âThe present authorization is not an expression of allied policy relative to ultimate determination of national jurisdiction, international boundaries or fishing rights in the area concerned or in any other area.â The claim of the ROK completely ignores this as well.
The MacArthur Line was abolished on April 25th, 1952, and with the San Francisco Peace Treaty coming into force three days later, on the 28th of April, the directives for cessation of governmental authority necessarily became invalid.
